# Introduction

C is one of the core programming languages that has influenced many other languages. It provides low-level access to memory and is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of C, its syntax, and how to use it effectively in your projects.

## What is C?

C is a high-level, procedural programming language that was developed in the early 1970s. It is known for its efficiency and control over system resources. C is often used for developing operating systems, compilers, and other performance-critical applications.

## Why Learn C?

1. **Efficiency**: C provides low-level access to memory, making it suitable for system-level programming.
2. **Portability**: Programs written in C can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes.
3. **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, are influenced by C.
4. **Job Opportunities**: Proficiency in C opens up numerous job opportunities in systems programming and embedded systems.

## Getting Started

To start coding in C, you need a text editor and a C compiler. You can write your C code in a `.c` file and compile it using a compiler like GCC.

### Example:

```c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
