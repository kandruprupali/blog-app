# Introduction

JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of JavaScript, its syntax, and how to use it effectively in your projects.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is widely used for client-side scripting, allowing developers to create rich, interactive user experiences. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server side, making it a versatile language for full-stack development.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

1. **Versatility**: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development.
2. **Popularity**: It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with a vast community and numerous resources.
3. **Frameworks and Libraries**: There are many frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that make development faster and easier.
4. **Job Opportunities**: Proficiency in JavaScript opens up numerous job opportunities in web development.

## Getting Started

To start coding in JavaScript, you need a text editor and a web browser. You can write your JavaScript code directly in an HTML file using the `<script>` tag or in a separate `.js` file.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>

    </script>
</body>
</html>
